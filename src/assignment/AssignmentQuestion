1.	Create a class Book which describes its Book_title and Book_price. Use getter and setter methods to get & set the Books description. 

Implement createBooks and showBooks methods to create n objects of Book in an array.  Display the books along with its description as follows:-

Book Title			Price
	Java Programming		Rs.350.50
	Let Us C			    Rs.200.00

Note: createBooks & showBooks should not be member functions of Book class.


2.	Write a program that accepts two numbers from the Command Line and prints them out. Then use a for loop to print the next 13 numbers in the sequence where each number is the sum of the previous two. For example:
	input> java prob2 1 3
	output> 1 3 4 7 11 18 29 47 76 123 322 521 843 1364

3.	Write a program that accepts two numbers in the range from 1 to 40 from the Command Line. It then compares these numbers against a single dimension array of five integer elements ranging in value from 1 to 40. The program displays the message BINGO if the two inputted values are found in the array element. For example:
	input>java prob3 3 29
	output>Your first number was 3
	       Your second number was 29
		Its Bingo! // this message if 3 and 29 is found in the array
		Not Found! // this message if 3 and 29 is not found in the array
		The array was 7 25 5 19 30

4.	Write a program that allows you to create an integer array of 18 elements with the following values: int A[]={3,2,4,5,6,4,5,7,3,2,3,4,7,1,2,0,0,0}. The program computes the sum of element 0 to 14 and stores it at element 15, computes the average and stores it at element 16 and identifies the smallest value from the array and stores it at element 17.

5. Create a class called complex for performing arithmetic operations with complex numbers. Use floating point variables to represent the private data of the class. Provide a default constructor that initializes the object with some default values. Provide public member functions for each of the following
	• Addition of two complex numbers: It returns the result obtained by adding the respective real parts and the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers.
	• Subtraction of two complex numbers: It returns the result obtained by subtracting the respective real parts and the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers.
	• display() – It displays the complex number in a+bi format.
The output should be displayed as follows:-	
Sum of  a1+b1 i   &   a2+b2 i     is  :  a3+b3 i

6. Write a program to take String from command line, display the length of the string. Also display the string into uppercase and lower case and check whether it is a palindrome or not using reverse method of StringBuffer/StringBuilder. (Refer Java API Documentation)
